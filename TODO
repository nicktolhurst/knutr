- [ ] Make the logs more colourful, right now, we have way too many logs close to the same colour, olives, greens, yellows, etc. Looks crap.
- [ ] I would like logs to show when Egress is ephemeral, DM, to channel, etc. I would also like to know if ingres was channel message, in thread, direct to bot, etc.
- [ ] Can we speed up builds in the `knutr` cli?
- [ ] Test Bed should have a way to perform some common database queries, I'm thinking !PG [query] for adding an entire postgres query, or !PG #channel 100 for something a little more pre-built. Any other useful diagnostic / test prebuild commands.
- [ ] Restrctyre plugins outside of src/ they should be in /plugin/exporter/, /plugins/pingpong/, /plugins/jargonbuster/.. everything that uses them like knutr cli deployemnts will need updating toos
- [ ] `knutr build` should take a list of projects to build: `knutr build core summeriser` for example. 
- [ ] `knutr build --all` is starting to take a very long time to build. Is there a nice dev experience focused way of doing this in parallel?
